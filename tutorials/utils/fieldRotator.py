        Parameters
        ----------
        ra0, dec0 are the coordinates of the original field
        center in degrees
        ra1, dec1 are the coordinates of the new field center
        in degrees
        The transform() method of this class operates by first
        applying a rotation that carries the original field center
        into the new field center.  Points are then transformed into
        a basis in which the unit vector defining the new field center
        is the x-axis.  A rotation about the x-axis is applied so that
        a point that was due north of the original field center is still
        due north of the field center at the new location.  Finally,
        points are transformed back into the original x,y,z bases.
