    "This notebook will illustrate the basics of accessing the DPDD-like object catalog, which contains the detected objects at the coadd level, through the Generic Catalog Reader (GCR, https://github.com/yymao/generic-catalog-reader) as well as how to select useful samples of stars/galaxies from the DM outputs.\n",

    "After going through this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "  1. Load and efficiently access a DC2 object catalog with the GCR\n",
    "  2. Understand and have references for the catalog schema\n",
    "  3. Apply cuts to the catalog using GCR functionalities\n",
    "  4. Have an example of quality cuts and simple star/galaxy separation cut\n",
    "  5. Load the HSC Public Data Release catalog in the XMM field [Advanced]\n",
