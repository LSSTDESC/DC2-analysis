    "__Learning objectives__:\n",
    "\n",
    "After going through this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "  1. Load and efficiently access a DC2 coadd catalog with the GCR\n",
    "  2. Understand and have references for the catalog schema\n",
    "  3. Apply cuts to the catalog using GCR functionalities\n",
    "  4. Have an example of quality cuts and simple star/galaxy separation cut\n",
    "  5. Load the HSC Public Data Release catalog in the XMM field [Advanced]\n",
    "\n",
    "__Logistics__: This notebook is intended to be run through the JupyterHub NERSC interface available here: https://jupyter-dev.nersc.gov.
