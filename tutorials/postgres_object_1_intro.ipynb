    "Last Verified to Run: \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an introduction to use of the PostgreSQL database at NERSC.  Currently the only fully supported datasets are the object catalogs for Run1.2i and Run1.2p v4. Since object catalogs as well as other kinds of catalogs are also available via GCR one might question the need for another form of access.  The justification (for those applications only using object catalogs) is performance. Typical queries such as the one labeled `q5` below run significantly faster.  Ingest also tends to be faster. The Run1.2p v4 data was available via PostgreSQL within a day of the completion of stack processing and transfer to NERSC.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Learning objectives__:\n",
    "\n",
    "After going through this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "  1. Connect to the DESC DC2 PostgreSQL database at NERSC.\n",
    "  2. Find out what tables are in the database, what their constituent columns are, and how they relate to DPDD and native object catalog quantities.\n",
    "  3. Make queries, selecting columns of interest subject to typical cuts. \n",
    "  4. Make use of standard tools, such as a Pandas, for plotting or other analysis of query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Logistics__: This notebook is intended to be run through the JupyterHub NERSC interface available here: https://jupyter-dev.nersc.gov. To setup your NERSC environment, please follow the instructions available here: https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LSSTDESC/Using+Jupyter-dev+at+NERSC\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "* A file ~/.pgpass containing a line like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`nerscdb03.nersc.gov:54432:desc_dc2_drp:desc_dc2_drp_user:`_password_\n",
    "\n",
    "This line allows you to use the desc_dc2_drp_user account, which has *SELECT* privileges on the database, without entering a password in plain text. There is a separate account for adding to or modifying the database. .pgpass must be protected so that only owner may read and write it.\n",
    " \n",
    "You can obtain the file by running the script `/global/common/software/lsst/dbaccess/postgres_reader.sh`.  It will copy a suitable file to your home directory and set permissions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have a `.pgpass` file in your home directory the script will stop without doing anything to avoid clobbering your file.  In that case, see the file `reader.pgpass` in the same directory.  You can merge it into your `.pgpass` file by hand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Access to the psycopg2 package which provides a Python interface to PostgreSQL. The recommended way to achieve this is to use the desc-python kernel on jupyter-dev.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This notebook uses psycopg2 directly for queries.  It is also possible to use sqlalchemy but you will still need a PostgreSQL driver. Of these psycopg2 is the most popular.\n"
