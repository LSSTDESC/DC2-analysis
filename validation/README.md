# Introduction

This directory contains notebooks related to the validation work
being performed for the different DC2 runs. 

These tutorials are intended to be run at NERSC using jupyter-dev. If you are unsure
on how to proceed, please go [here](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/DC2-analysis/tree/master/tutorials).

You are encouraged to use the code in these notebooks for your own analysis.
