    "\n",
    "You can access further information from the native_quantities. To understand these we must talk a little about the procedure to add galaxies to the simulation. The base of both Skysim and cosmoDC2 is the Outer Rim simulation, which defines the halo positions on the sky. This Outer Rim halo is referred to in the native quantities as the **target** halo. This is an FOF halo measured with a linking length of b=0.168, with a central position given by the minimum potential point. \n",
    "\n",
    "To add galaxies to this simulation, we use a Monte Carlo resampling of galaxies from the Universe Machine simulation. In this, galaxies are assigned to halos from the MultiDark Planck 2 (MDPL2), using the Universe Machine prescription, tuned to observations. This MDPL2 halo is referred to as the **host** halo. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Briefly, for every host\n",
    "halo in the Outer Rim, we randomly select a host halo in\n",
    "MDPL2 of similar mass, and map the galaxy content of the\n",
    "selected MDPL2 halo into the Outer Rim halo, preserving\n",
    "the halo-centric positions and velocities of the galaxies.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The **source** halos also pertain to the UMachine catalog, and give the ID and mass values for matching to MDPL2. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then add extra properties by running the Galacticus semi-analytic model on the Alpha Quadrant (a smaller analog to Outer Rim), and creating a set of galaxies with properly correlated properties which are used as a library from which we select in color and redshift space to add complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking for halo properties you'll want to look at those of the **target halo**, however the host halo information for the matching halo from the Universe Machine simulation is retained as well. Please look at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06530 if this is confusing, especially Figure 1. "

    "\n",
    "**Known issues/ limitations**\n",
    "- The color distribution has some discreteness?\n",
    "  - This is a limitation of the sampling method, causing some redshift-related discreteness. See the paper for more details \n",
    "- The red sequence looks too strong?\n",
    "  - This had to be amplified for redmapper to run successfully. This has complicated selection functions and we couldn't both maintain full realism and meet the requirement for redmapper to run with the person-power available. If you need more realistic colors please consider using the more recent Roman-Rubin simulations\n",
    "- I found some odd duplicate clusters?\n",
    "  - There was a bug in cosmoDC2 where ranks disagreed as to the ownership of some fragment halos, this led to a very small number of doubled-up halos in the map. Since this exists in the image simulation we chose not to fix this bug in cosmoDC2 for consistency. To find this you could cut on halo mass and then see if you have two halos of the same mass with different IDs in the same location and exclude those from your sample, but the recommended solution if you don't need images is to use skysim to look at the halo catalog which doesn't have this issue and has a much larger sky area so more clusters to look at. \n",
    "\n",
    "**IDS**\n",
    "- Why are there negative target_halo_ids?\n",
    "  - Negative target_halo_ids exist when the merger-tree object associated with the halo is a fragment halo, this happens when we want to distinguish fly-by type events from true mergers. You can extract the FOF halo tag from this fragment ID. \n",
    "  - The target_halo_fof_halo_id value for these fragment objects is assigned to be 0\n",
    "- Why does the distribution of target_halo_ids look weird?\n",
    "  - the fragment IDs use bit masking to combine the FOF halo id with a fragment index, this results in a slightly strange looking distribution for fragment IDs. \n",
    "- Why is my source_halo_id -1 or 0? \n",
    "  - These are fill values, there is no source halo from the Umachine catalog. This could be a synthetic source added to amplify the cluster red sequence, or a background unclustered galaxy added to adjust the number density (in this case target_halo_id may also be -1 or 0).   \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Masses**\n",
    "- Why are the halo masses different to the target halo masses?\n",
    "  - See above notes on units, the halo mass is in Msun, and the target halo mass is in Msun/h (h=0.71 for this simulation)\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Simulation** \n",
    "- Where can I find information on the cosmology/ other details of the Outer Rim simulation? Or of cosmoDC2?\n",
    "  - The best place to look is the cosmoDC2 paper, found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06530\n",
    "  - More information can be found in the Outer Rim paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11970 \n",
    "- Can I get the base simulation data? \n",
    "  - Yes, a subset of the data can be found here https://cosmology.alcf.anl.gov/ this includes a sample of snapshot data, and lightcone data \n",
    "    including halo catalogs \n",
    "    \n",
    "## FAQs - _Skysim_\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the difference between CosmoDC2 and skysim?\n",
    "  - Skysim is a more recent and much larger extragalactic catalog, incorporating improvements and bug fixes to cosmoDC2 using the same or similar base methods and simulations. These include higher resolution weak lensing, fixes to the lensing deflection angles, color model improvements, triaxiality, and additional halo information. \n",
    "\n",
    "**IDS**\n",
    "- Why is the halo catalog slightly different to CosmoDC2?\n",
    "  - See above known issue in cosmoDC2 with a very small number of duplicate halos, we also have different cuts on the galaxy magnitudes which result in a different halo sample. \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Masses**\n",
    "- My SOD mass/ other quantities are 0 or -1?\n",
    "  - This means one of three things, the halo mass might be too low for an SOD measurement, an SOD measurement may have failed, or this could be a synthetic field galaxy which is not associated with a halo. \n",
