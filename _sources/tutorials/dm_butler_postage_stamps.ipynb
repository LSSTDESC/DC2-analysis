    "# DC2: Generate Postage Stamps for set of RA, Dec coordinates\n",
    "<br>Owner: **Michael Wood-Vasey** ([@wmwv](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/DC2-analysis/issues/new?body=@wmwv))\n",
    "<br>Last Verified to Run: **2018-10-26** (by @yymao)\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook demonstrates taking a list of RA, Dec positions and generating \"postage-stamp\" cutout images from the coadded images.  It illustrates using `matplotlib` for simple display and saving of PNGs.  It also introduces using `lsst.afw.display` to use a more DM-product aware visualization to show the detect object footprints and other mask planes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "After working through and studying this Notebook you should be able to\n",
    "   1. Generate a postage stamp from a coadd for your chosen RA, Dec in a chosen filter and save as (a) a FITS file and (b) a PNG.\n",
    "   2. Use afw.display to show a postage stamp along with the mask planes from the coadd image, including overlaying the object footprints.\n",
    "   3. [Advanced] Instantiate a Butler object for a repo and read an arbitrary coadd image.  This will require reading through functions carefully and testing individual lines.  \n",
    "   4. [Advanced] Load the PSF model for a coadd and evaluate it at a given RA, Dec.\n",
    "   5. [Expert] Subtract a scaled PSF model from the location of an object on a coadd.\n",
    "   6. [Expert] Look up which tract, patch a given RA, Dec falls in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistics\n",
    "This is intended to be runnable at NERSC through the https://jupyter-dev.nersc.gov interface from a local git clone of https://github.com/LSSTDESC/DC2-analysis in your NERSC directory.  But you can also run it wherever, with appropriate adjustment of the 'repo' location to point to a place where you have a Butler repo will all of the images.
