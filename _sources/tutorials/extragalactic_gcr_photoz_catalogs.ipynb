    "There are photo-z estimates in the form of both a single number \"point estimate\" for each galaxy, as well as a 1D redshift probability density function (PDF) representing the posterior probability of the galaxy being at a given redshift calculated on a specific redshift grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple single point estimates:\n",
    "1. `photoz_mode`: the mode of the redshift PDF, the highest peak of the posterior probability\n",
    "2. `photoz_mean`: the weighted mean of the redshift PDF.\n",
    "3. `photoz_median`: the redshift where the redshift CDF is equal to 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The redshift pdf is stored in the multi-valued column `photoz-pdf`.  The grid of redshifts at which the posterior probability is evaluated is stored in the catalog with the special attribute of `photoz_pdf_bin_centers`.  You can access this attribute for catalog cat with something like `zgrid = cat.photoz_pdf_bin_centers`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three additional columns that can be used as various quality flags:\n",
    "1. `photoz_odds` (see Benitez 2000) is a measure of the integrated amount or probaility within a fixed distance around `photoz_mode`.  If the redshift posterior is single peaked and narrow this number will be close to 1.0, if the posterior is multi-peaked and/or broad it is likely to be smaller.  Thus, high values of `photoz_odds` can be used as an indicator of photo-z quality.\n",
    "2. `photoz_mode_ml_red_chi2` is the reduced chi-squared value for the maximum likelihood estimate of the best fit template at the photo-z mode.  If this chi-squared value is very large, it indicates that none of the SED templates employed by the photo-z code were good fits to the observed colors, and thus the redshift may be suspect. High values may also occur for very bright galaxies where photometric errors are small and thus chi-squared values can grow large.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate access methods for several of these quantities in detail. You can notice that all the photo-z columns have a prefix of `photoz_`. \n",

At low signal-to-noise in the magnitudes, the fits for the photometric redshifts become more and more uncertain.  For cosmology sample photo-z's, a general rule is that you want S/N in at least a few bands to be >~20 (you might be able to get away with S/N of around 10 but the photo-z's will be less reliable).  For our 10-year depth error simulation, a S/N in i-band corresponds to an i magnitude of roughly 25, and the points shown in red show a much better agreement with the specz=photo-z diagonal in the above plot, with some obvious areas of degeneracy. \n",

Many of these galaxies will still have a high ODDS value, so a combination of ODDS and photoz_ml_red_chi2 may eliminate more outliers  However, in both cases, this is at the expense of also eliminating some good galaxies, and the potential to introduce biases in overall distributions: both ODDS and chi^2 are correlated with template/SED type, so cuts on these values can affect the distribution of the galaxies selected.

This method was trained with a complete and representative (and thus unrealistic for real data) subsample of the DC2 data that extended to i<25.0, and provides excellent photo-z's for the i<25.0 galaxies.  The structure of the catalog is exactly the same as the one for the template-based photo-z's produced with the BPZ code that was used above.  However, as there are no templates, the `photoz_ml_red_chi2` quantity is not applicable, and has 0.0 in every entry.  Let's load the catalog and make the same `photoz_mode` and `photoz_mean` plots that we did for the BPZ photo-z's:"

    "The bright sample looks extremely good, with almost no catastrophic outliers, while the faint galaxies extending to i<26.5 show some periodic systematics in the photoz_mode values. This is due to how FlexZBoost parameterizes the PDF as a set of 30 cosine basis functions, and at low S/N objects tend to have peaks at the nodes of these basis functions.  The training data for FlexZBoost extended down to i<25.0, so the combination of lower S/N and lack of training data below i>25.0 combines to give very unreliable photo-z's for those i>25.0 galaxies.  Another good reminder to not trust machine learning methods in regions where the data must be extrapolated beyond the training data.\n",
